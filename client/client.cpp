class Client {


	// Client is a simple class which will look after the following tasks:
	// 	1. Listening the video channel and render it on the screen of the client. The information will be just the location 
	// 		of differnt objects , players items and so on. 
	// 	2. Define an interface to the command generation logic which could a human player or a simple bot generating the input commands.
	// 		Sending these commands to the input buffer of the server ( through another channel differnt from the above video channel). 
	// 		So there are 2 socket connections to the server for each client class.
